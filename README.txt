This replication package contains code to reproduce the analysis, tables, and figures included in the main text of the paper.Due to the PII nature of the data as well as to protect the anonymous case institution and students involved, the underlying data and the identity of the case university cannot be made public. Author access to the data was facilitated through the Pathways Network, which has an institutional relationship and data use agreement for access to the data. Questions about data access and requirements should be directed to Pathways Director, Professor Mitchell Stevens (stevens4@stanford.edu) at the Stanford University Graduate School of Education. Access to the data is at the discretion of the anonymous case university on a case by case basis, and data may not be available to external researchers. For more on the specific course search platform leveraged in this study, see Chaturapruek et al. (2021).

Instructions: Executing the master script (_MAIN.do) will run the analysis and generate all figures and tables. Prior to running the file, users will need to change the global macros at the top of the Main do file script. All analyses were run using Stata 17.
