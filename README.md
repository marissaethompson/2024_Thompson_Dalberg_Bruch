This replication package contains code to reproduce the analysis, tables, and figures included in the main text of the paper. Unfortunately, due to the sensitivity of the data used for analyses and privacy agreements with the case university, we are unable to provide the underlying data. 

Instructions: Executing the master script (_MAIN.do) will run the analysis and generate all figures and tables. Prior to running the file, users will need to change the global macros at the top of the Main do file script. All analyses were run using Stata 17.
